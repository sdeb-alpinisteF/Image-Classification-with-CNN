This project is in computer vision: Identifying bird species with Convolutoinal Neural Network based on Kaggle data 
1. Data: 400 species of birds with 62,000 images to train 
2. Part one: a baseline model with simple convolutional neural networ built from sctratch based on the two fundamental principles of computer vision, 
𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 and 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐡𝐢𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐲.
3. Part two: Designing a feedforward classifier on top of a pre-train convolutional base. I used VGG16 inthis case. 
4. Primarily, I have used a subset of all species, 100 species and all images corresponding to them, 15,000 in total.
